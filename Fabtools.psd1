            Version 0.7.0.4:
            - Fix a bug where the Fabric API didn't have a result URI

            Version 0.7.0.3:
            - Fixed the functions related to checking, pausing and activating Fabric capacities in Azure

            Version 0.7.0.2:
            - Fixed a bug that made the the module return an error on the first attempt to get data from the Rest API.

            Version 0.7.0.1:
            - Removed the parameter outfile in the function Invoke-FabricAPIRequest, as it led to an error in PowerShell version 7.4

            Version 0.7.0:
            - The official Rest API for Microsoft Fabric is now Public. This means that there are a lot of new possibilities for this module.
            - After a great talk with Rui Romano, he's graciously allowed us to integrate the functions from his project: fabricps-pbip (https://github.com/RuiRomano/fabricps-pbip) into Fabtools.
            - Lots of new functions to make it easier to work with Microsoft Fabric.
            - It is now possible to export and import items from a workspace. Currently that includes reports (pbip), semantic models (datasets), spark jobs, and notebooks (ipynb).
            - It is now possible to register and unregister a workspace to/from a capacity.
            - Several functions have been rewritten to use the new fabric API endpoint rather than the old PowerBI API endpoint.

            Version 0.6.0:
            - Added Get-AllFabricCapacities function to get all capacities in a tenant.
            - Added Invoke-FabricDatasetRefresh function to refresh a dataset.
            - Changed the main functions to be with the Fabric prefix instead of Fab, and added Fab as aliases.
            - Added IconUri to the manifest.
